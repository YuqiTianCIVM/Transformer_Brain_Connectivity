#### 1. Background & Initial CNN Attempts 

  

I first implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) on tabular data—combining scalar diffusion metrics (FA, MD, etc.) and traditional network measures across 360 ROIs—for \~50 mouse experiments. Despite aggressive regularization and data augmentation, the CNN overfit (training loss→0, validation accuracy fluctuating around chance), yielding no robust disease signature. 

I copied the epochs here. Because the data size is small, validation set is also very small, and each validation unit error leads to a leap in val acc.

#### 2. Rationale for a Transformer Approach 

  

Based on recent work in graph transformers and attention mechanisms, I concluded that contextual relationships in connectivity matrices (akin to language context in GPT) are crucial. By learning a “default” healthy wiring template and then spotting disease‐specific deviations, a transformer can capture subtle long‑range dependencies that a CNN on tabular features missed. 

 

  

Figure 2. Conventional methods—including both direct calculation and graph theory-based approaches—are typically limited to node-to-node or patch-based analyses, and are unable to capture broader contextual connectivity patterns. 

onnections.  

#### 3. Proposed Method 

 Given the consideration on the specimen number, I’m considering to use Allen atlas for pretraining and find the “contextual” pattern in normal mouse brain wiring, then based on that, find the difference between AD mouse brain and Normal Control.  

1. **Pretrain on the connectivity Atlas** 

  

    * Self‑supervised tasks (masked‑edge reconstruction or contrastive learning) on \~1,850 atlas connectivity graphs to train a multi‑layer Graph Transformer encoder. 

  

2. **Adapt & Fine‑Tune** 

  

   * **Freeze** the pretrained encoder. 

   * **Attach** a lightweight readout + classification head (global pooling → MLP) for AD vs. NTg. 

   * **Fine‑tune** only that head on the small mouse dataset, using early stopping and cross‑validation. 

  

3. **Interpretability** 

  

   * Inspect attention weights and readout gradients to identify critical regions and wiring changes. 

  

#### 4. Resources & Timeline 

  

* **Hardware:** NVIDIA A100 GPU (40 GB), 16 CPU cores, 64 GB RAM. 

* **Storage:** \~10 GB for graphs and checkpoints. 

* **Pretraining:** \~1–2 hr for 100 epochs on Atlas (batch size 16). 

* **Fine‑Tuning:** \~10–20 min for 50 epochs on AD vs. NTg data. 

* **Timeline:** 

  • Weeks 1–2: Data ingestion & model setup. 

  • Weeks 3–4: Transformer pretraining. 

  • Weeks 5–6: Adaptation, fine‑tuning & interpretability. 

  

#### 5. Feasibility 

  

Atlas pretraining “teaches” the model healthy mouse‐brain wiring without AD labels. 

  

1. **Connectivity Patterns:** The encoder internalizes wiring motifs via masked‑edge or contrastive losses. 

2. **Compact Embeddings:** Raw 360×360 matrices reduce to low‑variance latent vectors, mitigating overfitting. 

3. **Sample Efficiency:** Fine‑tuning only a head accelerates convergence and boosts accuracy with few labels. 

4. **Interpretability & Regularization:** Pretrained weights anchor the model in broad Atlas variation, discouraging spurious fits. 

  

#### 6. Difficulties 

  

1. Mismatch between Allen atlas region names and our RCCA labels. 

2. Uncertainty whether a Graph Transformer or Vision Transformer suits connectivity data best. 

3. Risk that the transformer may not converge to meaningful embeddings given the complexity and variability of mouse brains. 

  

#### 7. Conclusion 

  

This approach leverages large, unlabeled Atlas graphs to build a robust transformer backbone, enabling efficient, interpretable AD vs. NTg classification on a small mouse cohort.
